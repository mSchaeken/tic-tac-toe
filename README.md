# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Description

A straight and simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Currently only two player gameplay is supported, but in the future a computer opponent of varying difficulty levels including an unbeatable opponent (using a minimax algorithm) will be added.

## Project goals

I created this project in order to practice javascript OOP principles and learning how to code something without using the global namespace by making use of IIFE's. One of the biggest hurdles was managing the constantly changing context of the `this` keyword. Another challenge was building my modules in a way that makes sensible use of private and public functions. Meaning you don't end up returning every single function as a public function in the end. I'm still not completely satisfied with the result, but seeing how time is limited and there's still a lot more to learn, it's time to move on to a new project.

Creating a design for the app itself took a bit of time, but wasn't the main focus of the project. Hence the rather minimal approach.
